## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation

#### Dataset Composition
- **Total Images**: 436 high-resolution images
- **Training Set**: 375 images (203 ripe, 172 unripe)
- **Test Set**: 61 images (31 ripe, 30 unripe)
- **Image Resolution**: Variable (resized to standard dimensions)
- **Collection Date**: November 29, 2023
- **Collection Method**: Field photography under natural conditions

#### Data Preprocessing
```python
# Standardization pipeline
def preprocess_image(image_path, target_size=(100, 100)):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image = cv2.resize(image, target_size)
    return image
```

### 2. Feature Engineering

#### Evolution from Basic to Advanced Features

**Phase 1: Basic Features (3 features)**
```python
# Simple HSV color analysis
features = [
    np.mean(hue_channel),
    np.mean(saturation_channel), 
    np.mean(value_channel)
]
```

**Phase 2: Enhanced Features (46 features)**
```python
# Comprehensive feature extraction
features = [
    # Color Features (12): HSV + RGB means and standard deviations
    # Color Ratios (2): Red/Green ratio (key innovation)
    # Texture Features (2): Gradient-based surface analysis
    # Statistical Features (6): Skewness and kurtosis per channel
    # Histogram Features (24): Color distribution patterns
]
```

#### Key Innovation: Red/Green Ratio
```python
red_green_ratio = np.mean(red_channel) / (np.mean(green_channel) + 1e-6)
```
- **Biological Basis**: Ripening increases red pigmentation
- **Feature Importance**: 15.7% (highest in Random Forest)
- **Threshold**: Values > 1.0 typically indicate ripeness

def ensemble_predict(predictions, confidences):
    votes = {'ripe': 0, 'unripe': 0}
    for pred, conf in zip(predictions, confidences):
        votes[pred.lower()] += conf
    
    final_pred = max(votes, key=votes.get)
    ensemble_conf = max(votes.values()) / sum(votes.values())
    return final_pred, ensemble_conf
```
