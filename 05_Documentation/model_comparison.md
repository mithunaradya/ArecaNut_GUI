## 🎯 Ensemble Strategy

### Voting Mechanism
```python
# Weighted voting based on confidence
total_votes = {
    'ripe': knn_confidence + rf_confidence + svc_confidence,
    'unripe': 0  # (if all predict ripe)
}

final_prediction = max(total_votes, key=total_votes.get)
ensemble_confidence = max(total_votes.values()) / sum(total_votes.values())
```

### Why Ensemble Works
1. **Diversity**: Different algorithms capture different patterns
2. **Robustness**: Single model failures don't affect final result
3. **Confidence**: Agreement increases reliability
4. **Complementary**: Traditional ML + Deep Learning approaches
