tensorflow>=2.20.0

# Note: System Performance Options
# ================================
# Option 1: Full System (with TensorFlow)
#   - All 4 models: KNN, Random Forest, SVC, CNN
#   - Best possible accuracy with ensemble voting
#   - Larger installation size (~500MB)
#
# Option 2: Lightweight System (without TensorFlow)  
#   - 3 models: KNN, Random Forest, SVC
#   - 98.7% accuracy (excellent performance)
#   - Smaller installation size (~50MB)
#   - Comment out tensorflow line above

# Installation Commands:
# ======================
# Full system:    pip install -r requirements.txt
# Lightweight:    pip install opencv-python scikit-learn numpy Pillow
